Math modeling lab:
We lookes the motion of an object thrown or projected into the air, subject to only the acceleration of gravity use python. 
The motion of falling objects is a simple one-dimensional type of projectile motion in which there is no horizontal movement. 
Air resistance of this projectile is negligible.
