<br>We lookes the motion of an object thrown or projected into the air, subject to only the acceleration of gravity use python. 
<br>The motion of falling objects is a simple one-dimensional type of projectile motion in which there is no horizontal movement. 
<br>Air resistance of this projectile is negligible.
